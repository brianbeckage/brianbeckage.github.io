<!--<h3>Identity</h3>-->

<p class="myPFormat">
    I was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania in the northern end of Appalachia.  I'm first generation to go to college in
    my family...
    My family were mechanics and police officers, coal miners and moonshiners, some in the center, some on the fringes
    of society. My father, in his late teens, enlisted in the military and I grew up on military bases widely scattered.
    I've lived in Vermont, Tennessee, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas, Florida, New York, the Philippines, New Mexico,
    and Pennsylvania.

    I am a mix of Celtic, Norse, and Native American ancestry. I have a strong attachment to the forests and mountains of
    North America, particularly the Appalachian mountains. I enjoy weightlifting, kickboxing, Zen meditation. and poetry.
    I am libertarian in my worldview--we all are free to live our lives as we choose...no one
    has authority over another.

    I'm married with four children. My wife is hispanic (from San Antonio) of native ancestry, with a tribal affiliation
    from the southwestern US. My own tribal ancestry is lost to time but is undoubtedly a northeastern people.

    The world as I know it is complex and mysterious and deeply spiritual.

<!-- One grandfather was a diesel mechanic,-->

<!--    across the United States and in the Philippines. Neither of my parents went to college and they worked multiple jobs-->
<!--    to get by and, at times, my brother and I were on the free and reduced lunch program. Later in-->

<br>
<p class="myPFormat myIndent">I am broadly interested in computation and complexity.
    I have specific interests in climate change, species diversity, forest dynamics,and
    the intersection of social processes with natural systems. I emphasize the use of
    quantitative approaches to investigate these systems, including statistical,
    analytical, and computational models.
<br>
<h3>Research projects</h3></p>
<br>
<p class="myPFormat myIndent"><b>Disturbance and Savanna Dynamics.</b> Disturbance frequency can
    exert a strong influence on patterns of diversity in forests and  interactions between
disturbances can have strong effects on community dynamics. I am studying the potential for feedbacks between fire and vegetation to mediate the
transition between forests, savannas, and open grassland systems using both empirical field
    studies and models.</p>
<br>
<p class="myPFormat myIndent"><b>Climate Change.</b>
    Forest responses to climate change.
        We have a variety of research projects studying the effects of
        climate change on forest demography, including the processes and
        constraints that operate at species' range limits, the influence of recent
        climate change on species distributions, and projecting future forest distributions
        under likely climate change scenarios. These projects are currently
        focused on species and forests across New England. </p>

<p class="myPFormat myIndent"> <b>Tree Diversity.</b> Understanding the mechanisms that maintain species diversity in forest
    stands is a central question in plant ecology. My past research in the southern Appalachians has
    examined the importance of
    several hypothesized mechanisms to maintaining species diversity.I have found little evidence
    supporting the role of regeneration niches,
    differential predation, or spatial heterogeneity in recruitment processes in
    contributing to species diversity within forest stands. I am interested in both empirical and
    theoretical studies of the role of
    neutral processes in  forests.</p>

<p class="myPFormat myIndent"><b>Complexity, NKS, and Ecology.</b>
    Ecological communities are  complex, nonlinear systems that often display
    emergent properties. I am  interested in the potential for simple models
    such as cellular automata to capture complex behaviors and properties using simple rules.
