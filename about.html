    I was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania in the northern end of Appalachia. I am a mix of Celtic, Norse, and Native American ancestry. I have a strong attachment to the forests and mountains of
    North America, particularly the Appalachian mountains. I enjoy weightlifting, kickboxing, Zen meditation. and poetry.
    I am libertarian in my worldview--we all are free to live our lives as we choose...no one
    has authority over another.</p>
<br>
<p class="myPFormat">
    I'm the first generation to go to college in my family....a family of mechanics and police officers, coal miners
    and moonshiners, some in the center, some on the fringes of society. My father was a career NCO in the military and I
    grew up on military bases. I've lived in Vermont, Tennessee, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas, Florida, New York,
    the Philippines, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<br>
<p class="myPFormat">
    I'm married with four children. My wife is Chicano (from San Antonio) of Native ancestry, with a tribal affiliation
    from the southwestern US (Apache). My own tribal ancestry is lost to time but is likely a northeastern people.
