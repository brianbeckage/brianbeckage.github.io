<!--<h3>Identity</h3>-->

<p class="myPFormat">
    I was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania in the northern end of Appalachia. I am a mix of Celtic, Norse, and Native American ancestry. I have a strong attachment to the forests and mountains of
    North America, particularly the Appalachian mountains. I enjoy weightlifting, kickboxing, Zen meditation. and poetry.
    I am libertarian in my worldview--we all are free to live our lives as we choose...no one
    has authority over another.
    
    I'm the first generation to go to college in my family. My family are mechanics and police officers, coal miners
    and moonshiners, some in the center, some on the fringes of society. My father was an NCO and I
    grew up on military bases. I've lived in Vermont, Tennessee, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas, Florida, New York,
    the Philippines, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania.

    I'm married with four children. My wife is hispanic (from San Antonio) of native ancestry, with a tribal affiliation
    from the southwestern US. My own tribal ancestry is lost to time but is undoubtedly a northeastern people.

<!--    The world as I know it is complex and mysterious and deeply spiritual.-->
</p>

<!-- One grandfather was a diesel mechanic,-->
<!--    my other was a police officer.  One grandfather would tell me about how he tended the family still during the-->
<!--    prohibition, while my great grandfather would tell me stories about working in the coal mines as a child. My parents-->
<!--    were teenagers and my father enlisted in the military and so I mostly grew up on military bases-->
<!--    across the United States and in the Philippines. Neither of my parents went to college and they worked multiple jobs-->
<!--    to get by and, at times, my brother and I were on the free and reduced lunch program. Later in-->
<!--    life my father took college courses through the military eventually earning a master's degree. I've lived in a-->
<!--    variety of places including Vermont, Tennessee, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas, Florida, New York, the-->
<!--    Philippines, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania.  Most of my formative years were spent in Florida and when asked where I-->
<!--    am from, I will answer 'Scranton', "Florida', or 'nowhere' depending on my mood.-->
