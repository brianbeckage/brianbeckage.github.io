Disturbance and Savanna Dynamics. Disturbance frequency can exert a strong influence on patterns of diversity in forests
    and interactions between disturbances can have strong effects on community dynamics. I am studying the potential for
    feedbacks between fire and vegetation to mediate the transition between forests, savannas, and open grassland systems
    using both empirical field studies and models.

Climate Change. Forest responses to climate change. We have a variety of research projects studying the effects of
    climate change on forest demography, including the processes and constraints that operate at species' range limits,
    the influence of recent climate change on species distributions, and projecting future forest distributions under
    likely climate change scenarios. These projects are currently focused on species and forests across New England.

Tree Diversity. Understanding the mechanisms that maintain species diversity in forest stands is a central question in
    plant ecology. My past research in the southern Appalachians has examined the importance of several hypothesized
    mechanisms to maintaining species diversity.I have found little evidence supporting the role of regeneration niches,
    differential predation, or spatial heterogeneity in recruitment processes in contributing to species diversity within forest stands. I am interested in both empirical and theoretical studies of the role of neutral processes in forests.

Complexity, NKS, and Ecology. Ecological communities are complex, nonlinear systems that often display emergent
    properties. I am interested in the potential for simple models such as cellular automata to capture complex
    behaviors and properties using simple rules.
