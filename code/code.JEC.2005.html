Please be aware that this model was fit in 1999 using a now long obselete version of Splus--thus the code will undoubtedly require modification to work in current versions of Splus or R. In addition, the Splus code calls three C routines, Design.mat.c, Gap.beta.c, and Qfun.c.  These portions of the code were exported to C to increase the speed of the program. The code contained in these files is very specific to the particular problem addressed in Beckage et al., Journal of Ecology, 2005.  I would suggest that this code would be most useful as a starting point for application to similar problems rather than being used simply as is. Finally, the code comes with no guarantees whatsoever with regards to accuracy or correctness. </p> <table width="200" border="1">   <tr>     <td><a href="survive.ssc">survive.ssc</a></td>     <td><a href="Qfun.c">Qfun.c</a></td>     <td><a href="Design.mat.c">Design.mat.c</a></td>     <td><a href="Gap.beta.c">Gap.beta.c</a></td>   </tr> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
