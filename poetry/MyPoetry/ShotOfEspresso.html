<h1>Morning Shot of Espresso</h1>
<h2>Brian Beckage
<br>
21 Apr 2021</h2>

<p>
  I think about hope<br>
  And how important it is,<br>
  Like caffeine,<br>
  to even care<br>
  to keep on keepinâ€™ on.<br>
  But sometimes when<br>
  I have no hope<br>
  I  sit on the floor and wait<br>
  For nothing, empty, surrendering to it all.<br>
  I sink into nothingness<br>
  and watch, like a child,<br>
  the sun move across the floor,<br>
  the dust float in the the sunbeams,<br>
  Each like a galaxy in a universe.<br>
  An ant wanders across the curves and lines<br>
  And soft edges of the rug I rest on.<br>
  Leaves flutter and sparkle in the wind,<br>
  Just outside my window,<br>
  A raven calls from a tree top,<br>
  And I awaken and look<br>
  For the problems that weighed me down.<br>
  I see them but they are light and carry no weight.<br>
  My waiting done , I get up<br>
  sip on a iced tea<br>
  brew a shot of espresso,<br>
  Lightness and light,<br>
  And  get on with the day<br>
  And feel joy to be part of it all.<br>
