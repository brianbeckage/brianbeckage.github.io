<h1>Buried Alive</h1>
<h2>B Fatboy
<br>
8 Feb 2021</h2>

<p>
  Dig a deep hole<br>
  In the woods behind the house<br>
  Lead me out there, no,<br>
  Drag me out there,<br>
  Maybe a shotgun<br>
  At the back of my head,<br>
  On my knees,<br>
  Bury me to my neck,<br>
  Make each breath a struggle,<br>
  And leave me there to die.<br>
  <br>
  No, instead,<br>
  Tie me to this machine,<br>
  Staring into a screen,<br>
  All day long,<br>
  Deep into the darkness of night.<br>
  Give me more than can be done<br>
  And make my life depend<br>
  On getting it done.<br>
  and remind me often<br>
  of how badly I’m doing.<br>
  <br>
  No time for a walk,<br>
  No time to stroll,<br>
  No time to stare out the window<br>
  At the birds, singing,<br>
  flitting about the trees,<br>
  From sun to shade,<br>
  And back again.<br>
  No time to envy their freedom,<br>
  Lightness of being, no,<br>
  I’m a prisoner,<br>
  of something,<br>
  Not sure what,<br>
  I can’t point to it or touch it,<br>
  But it makes my eyes twitch<br>
  And my jaw tight,<br>
  And my blood pressure high.<br>
  My soul will not abide,<br>
  My body cracks at the strain,<br>
  You might pull the trigger now,<br>
  Before it is too late,<br>
  Maybe, its already too late,<br>
  Sign me out,<br>
  I don’t care about your system,<br>
  My productivity, or the greater good,<br>
  Or obedience, or respect, or authority<br>
  Or any of the meaningless words<br>
  That hold me down<br>
  That pry my spirit from my body,<br>
  Ripping my being.<br>
  No more<br>
  I am done.<br>
  Leave me here,<br>
  To be,<br>
  So that my soul can rejoin my body,<br>
  And wander about the world and sing.<br>
