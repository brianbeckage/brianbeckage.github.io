<h1>Trauma Talking</h1>

<p>
  People puzzle me,<br>
  How they move so freely<br>
  Talk so openly<br>
  Trusting, oblivious…<br>
  They must be wolves,<br>
  Clever and cunning<br>
  Feigned indifference,<br>
  Hiding their true intent<br>
  Their natural predilection to violence<br>
  Waiting for an opportunity—<br>
  A turned back, a lapse in attention—<br>
  To unleash themselves and attack,<br>
  Cutting deeply into flesh and soul.<br>
  But I am ready, awake, and aware,<br>
  Trained in the combat arts,<br>
  Combat dagger tucked away,<br>
  Pistola in the truck, just in case.<br>
  But then I think,<br>
  They are just sheep,<br>
  Stupid and naive,<br>
  Blood waiting to be spilt,<br>
  And I am the wolf,<br>
  Watching and waiting<br>
  Ready for the turn to violence,<br>
  That I am sure is to come.<br>
  Any moment, any time,<br>
  And I am vigilant,<br>
  Feigning indifference,<br>
  As I wait for it to start,<br>
  And grow tired of pretending<br>
  That I am one of them.<br>
