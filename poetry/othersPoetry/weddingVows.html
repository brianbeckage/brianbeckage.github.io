<h1>Celtic wedding vow</h1>

<h2>Morgan Llywelyn</h2>

    <p>
        You cannot possess me for I belong to myself,<br>
        But while we both wish it, I give you that which is mine to give<br>
        You cannot command me, for I am a free person,<br>
        But I shall serve you in those ways you require and<br>
        The honeycomb will taste sweeter coming from my hand.<br>
        <br>
        I pledge to you that yours will be the name<br>
        I cry aloud in the night and the eyes into which I smile in the morning.<br>
        I pledge to you the first bite of my meat and the first drink from my cup<br>
        I pledge to you my living and my dying, each equally in your care<br>
        I shall be a shield for your back and you for mine<br>
        I shall not slander you, nor you me<br>
        I shall honor you above all others, and<br>
        When we quarrel we shall do so in private and<br>
        Tell no strangers our grievances.<br>
        <br>
        This is my wedding vow to you<br>
        This is the marriage of equals.<br>
    </p>
