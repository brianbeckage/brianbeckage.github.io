<h1>The Laws of God, the Laws of Man</h1>
<h2>A.E. Housman</h2>

<p>The laws of God, the laws of man,<br>
    He may keep that will and can;<br>
    Not I: let God and man decree<br>
    Laws for themselves and not for me;<br>
    And if my ways are not as theirs<br>
    Let them mind their own affairs.<br>
    Their deeds I judge and much condemn,<br>
    Yet when did I make laws for them?<br>
    Please yourselves, say I , and they<br>
    Need only look the other way.<br>
    But no, they will not; they must still<br>
    Wrest their neighbour to their will,<br>
    And make me dance as they desire<br>
    With jail and gallows and hell-fire.<br>
    And how am I to face the odds<br>
    Of man's bedevilment and God's?<br>
    I, a stranger and afraid<br>
    In a world I never made.<br>
    They will be master, right or wrong;<br>
    Though both are foolish, both are strong.<br>
    And since, my soul, we cannot fly<br>
    To Saturn nor to Mercury,<br>
    Keep we must, if keep we can,<br>
    These foreign laws of God and man.<br>
