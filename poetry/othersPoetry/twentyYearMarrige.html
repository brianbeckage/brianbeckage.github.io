<h1>Twenty Year Marriage</h1>
<h2>Ai</h2>

<p>You keep me waiting in a truck<br>
with its one good wheel stuck in the ditch,<br>
while you piss against the south side of a tree.<br>
Hurry. I’ve got nothing on under my skirt tonight.<br>
That still excites you, but this pickup has no windows<br>
and the seat, one fake leather thigh,<br>
pressed close to mine is cold.<br>
I’m the same size, shape, make as twenty years ago,<br>
but get inside me, start the engine;<br>
you’ll have the strength, the will to move.<br>
I’ll pull, you push, we’ll tear each other in half.<br>
Come on, baby, lay me down on my back.<br>
Pretend you don’t owe me a thing<br>
and maybe we’ll roll out of here,<br>
leaving the past stacked up behind us;<br>
old newspapers nobody’s ever got to read again.<br>
