<h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
<h2>Robert Frost</h2>

<p>Some say the world will end in fire,<br>
    Some say in ice.<br>
    From what I've tasted of desire<br>
    I hold with those who favor fire.<br>
    But if it had to perish twice,<br>
    I think I know enough of hate<br>
    To know that for destruction ice<br>
    Is also great<br>
    And would suffice.</p>
