<h1>Darkness of Winter</h1>

<br>

<p>
  Darkness increasing<br>
  Inside and out<br>
  Life everywhere<br>
  Holding on,<br>
  by a thin strand<br>
  of a spiderâ€™s web,<br>
  as winter tightens its stranglehold<br>
  Hope flickers<br>
  A small flame<br>
  In the vast, endless darkness.<br>
  Only a gust of wind,<br>
  An unexpected setback,<br>
  A slashing word,<br>
  To extinguish it.<br>
  Life that seems so strong<br>
  And unbendable in the brightness<br>
  And heat of summer<br>
  Hides, underground, beneath rocks<br>
  and stones,<br>
  Hopeful, hopeless, in turns,<br>
  Each breath, each heartbeat<br>
  A small victory,<br>
  Against the defeat that waits<br>
  Somewhere,<br>
  Out in all that dark and cold.<br>
