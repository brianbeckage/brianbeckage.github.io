<h1>Wendigo</h1>

<p>
  You raise a boy, a girl,<br>
  Giving them everything you have,<br>
  But all they want is more.<br>
  When they appear at your door<br>
  What is it they want,<br>
  What have they come for?<br>
  Not to talk, not to sit quietly,<br>
  Unhurriedly, long pauses between<br>
  Sharing of words or stories or<br>
  The sun setting behind the trees.<br>
  All they know to give is resentment<br>
  At not getting more, their hunger insatiable<br>
  A perfect reflection of our world.<br>
  What you wonâ€™t give, they try to take,<br>
  Your balance, identity, soul,<br>
  So that you too will become a wendigo,<br>
  In a bleak and barren world of wendigos.<br>
