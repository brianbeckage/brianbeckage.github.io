<h1>Brotherhood of the Lake</h1>

<p>
  I wade into the lake<br>
  the water is cold and clear<br>
  and well above my shoulders.<br>
  Raindrops splash all around<br>
  beautiful in their symmetry<br>
  endless in each
  of the four directions<br>
  north and south<br>
  east and west.<br>
  A flash of light and I wait<br>
  for the boom and it comes quickly.<br>
  Not to worry<br>
  it's all written in a book<br>
  from before you were born.<br>
  The others watch from the shore<br>
  I wave them in<br>
  they hesitate, uncertain<br>
  I say its good and wave again<br>
  and they come.<br>
  All of us wading in the lake<br>
  in a summer thunderstorm<br>
  indifferent to the lightning<br>
  waiting for what happens<br>
  wondering if this world ends<br>
  with the next flash<br>
  laughing and talking and enjoying the wait<br>
  brothers and sisters of the lake<br>
  the storm, the sky, the mountains<br>
  of all living things<br>
  all dead things<br>
  and all other things.<br>
<!--  and everything else. <br>-->
