<h1>brotherhood of the lake</h1>

<p>
  I wade into the lake,<br>
  in a lightning storm,<br>
  the water is cold and clear<br>
  and well above my shoulders,<br>
  raindrops splash all around<br>
  beautiful in their symmetry<br>
  endless in each direction<br>
  north and south<br>
  east and west<br>
  A flash of light and I wait<br>
  for the boom and it comes quickly,<br>
  not to worry<br>
  It's all written in a book<br>
  from before you were born.<br>
  The others watch from the shore,<br>
  I wave them in<br>
  but they hesitate, uncertain<br>
  I say its good, its fine<br>
  and then they come,<br>
  all of us wading in the lake,<br>
  indifferent to the lightning and thunder,<br>
  waiting to see what happens<br>
  if we die in the next flash,<br>
  but laughing and talking and enjoying the wait,<br>
   brothers and sisters of the lake,<br>
  the sky, the storm, the mountains,<br>
  and of all living things<br>
  and of all dead things<br>
  and all other things.<br>
