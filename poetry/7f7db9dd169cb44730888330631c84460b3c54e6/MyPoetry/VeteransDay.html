  The military fucked me up<br>
  or maybe was i born that way<br>
  hard to say<br>
  but i don't think so.<br>
  Does the military just attracts fucked up people<br>
  or does it make them?<br>
  The marine corps says  <br>
  leaders are not born but made<br>
  <!--  and not born that way<br>-->
  maybe the same principle applies?<br>
  don't know.<br>
  military fucks up the father<br>
  father fucks up the mother<br>
  they both fuck up the kids.<br>
  a clusterfuck. fubar.<br>
  definitely beyond repair<br>
  mp's and sp's<br>
  they come and go<br>
  and a lot of shit happens<br>
  but nothing happens.<br>
  the damage is done,<br>
  the fracture lines are deep<br>
  a hard blow<br>
  and then spalling and shrapnel<br>
  ricocheting around inside your head<br>
  <!--  and all around your life<br>-->
  and the marine corps delivers.<br>
  none of it matters <br>
  fuck it all<br>
  just put one foot in front of the other<br>
  <!--  one foot in front of the other<br>-->
  one breath and then another<br>
  repeat, repeat, and repeat some more<br>
  do what you can<br>
  looking for some kindness<br>
  looking for some love<br>
  and then pass it along<br>
  that's all there is<br>
  what else is there?<br>
  <!--  and everything else. <br>-->
