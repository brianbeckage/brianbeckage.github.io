<p>
  The military fucked me up<br>
  or maybe was i born that way<br>
  hard to say.<br>
  but i don't think so.<br>
  Does the military  attract fucked up people<br>
  or does it make them?<br>
  hard to say.<br>
  In the marine corps <br>
  leaders are made, not born.<br>
<!--  The marine corps says  <br>
  leaders are not born but made<br>-->
  <!--  and not born that way<br>-->
  Does the same principle apply?<br>
  don't know.<br>
  The military fucks up the father<br>
  father fucks up the mother<br>
  they both fuck up the kids.<br>
  a clusterfuck. fubar.<br>
  definitely beyond repair<br>
  mp's and sp's<br>
  come and go<br>
  a lot of shit happens<br>
  but nothing happens.<br>
  the damage is done,<br>
  the fractures are deep<br>
  a hard blow<br>
  and then spalling and shrapnel<br>
  ricocheting around inside your head<br>
  <!--  and all around your life<br>-->
  and the marine corps does deliver.<br>
  who's to blame<br>
  who's at fault?<br>
  hard to say.<br>
don't really matter, does it?<br>
  fuck it all<br>
  just put one foot in front of the other<br>
  <!--  one foot in front of the other<br>-->
  one breath and then another<br>
  repeat, repeat, and repeat some more<br>
  do what you can<br>
  looking for some kindness<br>
  looking for some love<br>
  and then pass it along<br>
  that's all there is<br>
  what else is there?<br>
  <!--  and everything else. <br>-->
