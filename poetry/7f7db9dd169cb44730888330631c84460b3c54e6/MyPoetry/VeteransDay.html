  Was I born this way<br>
  or did the military fucked me up?<br>
<!--  The military fucked me up<br>
  or maybe was i born that way<br>-->
  I don't think so,<br>
  but hard to say.<br>
  Does the military make us<br>
  or just attract us?<br>
  Good question,
  hard to say.<br>
  In the marine corps <br>
  leaders are made, not born.<br>
<!--  The marine corps says  <br>
  leaders are not born but made<br>-->
  <!--  and not born that way<br>-->
  maybe the same principle applies here?<br>
  don't know.<br>
  Maybe the military fucks up the father<br>
  father fucks up the mother<br>
  they both fuck up the kids.<br>
  a clusterfuck. fubar.<br>
  definitely beyond repair<br>
  mp's and sp's<br>
  come and go<br>
  a lot of shit happens<br>
  but nothing happens.<br>
  the damage is done,<br>
  the fractures are deep<br>
  a hard blow<br>
  and then spalling and shrapnel<br>
  ricochete around inside your head<br>
  <!--  and all around your life<br>-->
  and the marine corps can deliver a blow.<br>
  who's to blame<br>
  who's at fault?<br>
  hard to say.<br>
  don't really matter, does it?<br>
  idk, hard to say.<br>
  just put one foot in front of the other<br>
  <!--  one foot in front of the other<br>-->
  one breath and then another<br>
  repeat, repeat, and repeat some more<br>
  do what you can<br>
  looking for some kindness<br>
  looking for some love<br>
  if you find it<br>
  pass it along<br>
  that's all there is<br>
  what else is there?<br>
  idk, hard to say.<br>
  <!--  and everything else. <br>-->
