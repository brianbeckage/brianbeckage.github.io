<h1>Flowing Water</h1>

<!--  A stream by my house...-->
  </h2>

<p>
The water flows fast<br>
The water flows slow,<br>
Yielding to every stone that stands in its way.<br>
But sometimes it explodes with rage and white hot anger,<br>
Smashing everything that stands against it,<br>
Sweeping away earth and boulders,<br>
Battering against it all,<br>
The unkindness and arrogance and senselessness,<br>
Its violence stark and bare and witnessed by the altered shape of things,<br>
In what is gone, washed away,<br>
Until spent and exhausted and calm,<br>
It flows slow or fast,<br>
And sometimes not all.<br>
</p>

  <!--  and everything else. <br>-->
