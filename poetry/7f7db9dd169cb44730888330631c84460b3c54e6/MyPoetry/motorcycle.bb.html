<h1><strong>Motorcycle</strong></h1>
<h2>brian beckage<br>
Written around 1989 while an undergraduate student. A Seca is a
  motorcycle.</h2>
<p>Motorcycle. <br>
  Wind whistling through my helmet visor<br>
  Crisp, cold, and rustling<br>
  The autumn leaves<br>
  That paint the shaded lane.<br>
  A hand closes tighter,<br>
  Soft, feminine against <br>
  The contours of my leathered chest <br>
  Timidly exploring while <br>
  My Seca roars <br>
  Through a tunnel of trees <br>
  Beside a river that blows a cool breath. <br>
  Both in silence, isolated <br>
  Together we skim the earth <br>
  A blur of metal, leather, and flesh.<br>
