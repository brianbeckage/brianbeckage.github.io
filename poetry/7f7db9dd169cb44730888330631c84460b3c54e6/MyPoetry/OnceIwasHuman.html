Who are we? Who am I?<br>  Sometime long in the past,<br>  A fork in the road, a river crossed,<br>  A decision made, a system born<br>  A system spreads and consumes <br>  everything in its way,<br>  People, forests, buffalo,<br>  Transforming the Earth<br>  Into concrete and glass and asphalt<br>  Into blowing plastic bags and tossed beer cans<br>  And used syringes lying in fields of debris<br>  and here we are.<br>  <br>  One day, I will be a human being again <br>  When i am spent and discarded<br>  no longer of use to them,<br>  More of their trash on the side of the road.<br>  Or when they are of no use to me<br>  And I resist, a fifth column, a revolutionary<br>  A human being among human beings. <br>  Together we'll take it all back.<br></p><a href="../poetryTable_My.html">  <h3>Back to Poetry</h3></a></body></html>
