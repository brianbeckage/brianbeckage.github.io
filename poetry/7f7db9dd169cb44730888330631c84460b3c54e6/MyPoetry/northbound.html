<h1>Northbound</h1>

  </h2>

<p>
    A car northbound in the southbound lane<br>
    shoots past us in the dark<br>
    in the passing lane<br>
    where we were hurtling south just moments ago.<br>
    Nothing changes in the material world,<br>
    no crumpled metal<br>
    no broken bodies<br>
    scattered across the asphalt,<br>
    no long lines of traffic<br>
    backed up for miles in the night<br>
    as emergency workers clean up the mess.<br>
    No, none of that, nothing at all.<br>
    But everything changes<br>
    A reminder, a reinforcement, a renewed appreciation<br>
    that we are like fluff from a cottonwood tree<br>
    floating in the wind in early summer<br>
    random or not<br>
    not knowing when or where we'll land,<br>
    an end and a beginning.<br>
