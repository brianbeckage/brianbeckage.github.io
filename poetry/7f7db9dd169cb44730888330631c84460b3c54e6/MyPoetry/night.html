<p>
  I love the night.<br>
  what lies out there in the dark?<br>
  Who knows.<br>
  I don’t.<br>
  I like not knowing,<br>
  Not needing to know,<br>
  Not feeling that I should know.<br>
  It frees my spirit,<br>
  To fly, unencumbered<br>
  Silent and unseen,<br>
  Like an owl,<br>
  beneath the forest trees.<br>
  No need to get things done,<br>
  No pressures of the day,<br>
  No expectations,<br>
  No bosses, no supervisors<br>
  No one to please,<br>
  But yourself<br>
  Just be, breath, and be<br>
  Who you are.<br>
  My soul rejoices in the dark stillness,<br>
  Of the deep recesses of the night,<br>
  The 2am’s and 3am’s<br>
  free of obligation,<br>
  No one watching, no one awake<br>
  Alone with the universe<br>
  In the universe,<br>
  Bathed in the sounds of<br>
  katydids singing beneath a blanket of stars<br>
  The trees, the earth, the sky,<br>
  and me.<br>
