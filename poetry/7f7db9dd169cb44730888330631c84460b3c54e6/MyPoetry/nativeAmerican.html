<p>
  The mother looks native<br>
  most definitely<br>
    just like in the movies<br>
maybe navajo or apache,<br>
    but the kids look white<br>
  and so does he.<br>
  What does that mean?<br>
  maybe if I am an alcholic<br>
  or a fucked up drug addict<br>
    from a fucked up family<br>
 you would believe me?<br>
  My ancestors speak to me<br>
  I know who I am<br>
  no need for a card in my wallet<br>
  or a government paper<br>
  from the same fuckers that tried to kill them<br>
  to know who i am.<br>
