<p>
  The mother looks native<br>
  most definitely<br>
    like in the movies<br>
maybe navajo or apache,<br>
    but the kids look white<br>
    and so does he<br>
<!--    but the kids don't<br>-->
<!--    nor does he<br>-->
  no dancing with wolves.<br>
  And so what, kimosabe?<br>
  maybe if I am an alcholic<br>
  or a drug addict<br>
    from a fucked up family<br>
    living in a trailer<br>
    out in a mountain hollow<br>
 you would believe me?<br>
    Or maybe if I grew my hair long in a ponytail<br>
    and dripped turquoise<br>
    and spoke sparingly or not all?<br>
  My ancestors speak to me<br>
  I know who I am<br>
  no need for a card in my wallet<br>
  or a piece of paper<br>
  from the same government that tried to kill us all<br>
  to know who i am.<br>
