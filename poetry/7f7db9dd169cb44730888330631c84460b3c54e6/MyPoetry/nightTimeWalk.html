<h1>Nighttime Walk</h1>

<p>
  First, a beetle assaults me,<br>
  Flying into my head<br>
  Before I’ve even left my driveway.<br>
  Fireflies and lightning bugs,<br>
  Flash and pulsate at the edge of the forest<br>
  On the side of the road,<br>
  Up high into the trees.<br>
  I spot the silhouette of some animal,<br>
  Crouching low, before it slides into the woods<br>
  A bat flaps just above my head<br>
  Chasing a zigzagging moth<br>
  As I walk beneath a streetlight.<br>
  A dog complains loudly<br>
  As I near its house,<br>
  Safe behind a screened door,<br>
  From the fisher cat<br>
  That flits about our neighborhood.<br>
  An owl hoots in reply,<br>
  Then sweeps not far above me, silently,<br>
  To the oaks on my side of the street.<br>
  A cat is startled by the tap<br>
  of my walking stick on asphalt,<br>
  And freezes and crouches low as I pass by.<br>
  I step around the toads<br>
  that wait in the splashes of light<br>
  for the insects that can’t help<br>
  But fly there.<br>
  A raccoon, large and fat, waddles in front of me<br>
  Disappearing into a shadow,<br>
  As coyotes yip and howl somewhere over the ridge.<br>
  A turn a corner toward my house<br>
  And a fox darts across the road<br>
  Not far in front of me,<br>
  Low and stealthy,<br>
  Barely visible and only for a second,<br>
  And moves into the abandoned park,<br>
  Towards the basketball court,<br>
  Maybe looking for a pick up game.<br>
  Life and wildness seep from all the cracks and seams,<br>
  Soon as the people retreat into their homes<br>
  Sealing out the dark,<br>
  Huddling in front of their glowing boxes.<br>
