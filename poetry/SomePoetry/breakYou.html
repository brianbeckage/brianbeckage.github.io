<h1>Life will break you</h1>
<h2>Louise Erdrich</h2>

<p>Life will break you.<br>
  Nobody can protect you from that,<br>
  and being alone won't either,<br>
  for solitude will also break you with its yearning.<br>
  You have to love.<br>
  You have to feel.<br>
  It is the reason you are here on earth.<br>
  You have to risk your heart.<br>
  You are here to be swallowed up.<br>
  And when it happens that you are broken,<br>
  or betrayed,<br>
  or left,<br>
  or hurt,<br>
  or death brushes too near,<br>
  let yourself sit by an apple tree<br>
  and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps,<br>
  wasting their sweetness.<br>
  Tell yourself that you tasted as many as you could.<br>
