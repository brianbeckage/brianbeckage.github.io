<h1>Feeling Fucked Up</h1>

<h2>Etheridge Knight</h2>

<p>Lord she’s gone done left me done packed / up and split<br>
and I with no way to make her<br>
come back and everywhere the world is bare<br>
bright bone white    crystal sand glistens<br>
dope death dead dying and jiving drove<br>
her away made her take her laughter and her smiles<br>
and her softness and her midnight sighs—<br><br>

Fuck Coltrane and music and clouds drifting in the sky<br>
fuck the sea and trees and the sky and birds<br>
and alligators and all the animals that roam the earth<br>
fuck marx and mao fuck fidel and nkrumah and<br>
democracy and communism fuck smack and pot<br>
and red ripe tomatoes fuck joseph fuck mary fuck<br>
god jesus and all the disciples fuck fanon nixon<br>
and malcolm fuck the revolution fuck freedom fuck<br>
the whole muthafucking thing<br>
all i want now is my woman back<br>
so my soul can sing</p>
