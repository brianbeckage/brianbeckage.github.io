<h1>Children of Flame and Ash</h1>
<h2>from Smoke Signals</h2>

<p>
  You know there are some children<br>
  who aren't really children at all,<br>
  they're just pillars of flame<br>
  that burn everything they touch.<br>
  And there are some children<br>
  who are just pillars of ash,<br>
  that fall apart when you touch them...<br>
  Victor and me,<br>
  we were children of flame and ash.<br>
