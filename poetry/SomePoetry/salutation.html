<h1>Salutation</h1>
<h2>Ezra Pound</h2>

<p>Generation of the thoroughly smug<br>
  and the thoroughly uncomfortable,<br>
  I have seen fishermen picknicking in the sun,<br>
  I have seen them with untidy families,<br>
  I have seen their smiles full of teeth<br>
  and heard ungainly laughter.<br>
  And I am happier than you are,<br>
  And they were happier than I am;<br>
  And the fish swim in the lake<br>
  and do not even own clothing.</p>
