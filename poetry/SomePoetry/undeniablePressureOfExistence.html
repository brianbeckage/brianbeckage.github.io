<h1>Undeniable Pressure of Existence</h1>

<h2>Patricia Fargnoli</h2>

<p>I saw the fox running by the side of the road<br>
    past the turned-away brick faces of the condominiums<br>
    past the Citco gas station with its line of cars and trucks<br>
    and he ran, limping, gaunt, matted dull haired<br>
    past Jim's Pizza, past the Wash-O-Mat,<br>
    past the Thai Garden, his sides heaving like bellows<br>
    and he kept running to where the interstate<br>
    crossed the state road and he reached it and he ran on<br>
    under the underpass and beyond it past the perfect<br>
    rows of split-levels, their identical driveways<br>
    their brookless and forestless yards,<br>
    and from my moving car, I watched him,<br>
    helpless to do anything to help him, certain he was beyond<br>
    any aid, any desire to save him, and he ran loping on,<br>
    far out of his element, sick, panting, starving,<br>
    his eyes fixed on some point ahead of him,<br>
    some possible salvation<br>
    in all this hopelessness, that only he could see.</p>
