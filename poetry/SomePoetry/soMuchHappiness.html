<h1>So Much Happiness</h1>
<h2>Naomi Shihab Nye</h2>
<h3>from Words under the Words (The Eighth Mountain Press).</h3>

<p>So Much Happiness<br>
  It is difficult to know what to do with so much happiness.<br>
  With sadness there is something to rub against, <br>
  a wound to tend with lotion and cloth.<br>
  When the world falls in around you, you have pieces to pick up,<br>
  something to hold in your hands, like ticket stubs or change.<br><br>

  But happiness floats.<br>
  It doesn't need you to hold it down.<br>
  It doesn't need anything.<br>
  Happiness lands on the roof of the next house, singing,<br>
  and disappears when it wants to.<br>
  You are happy either way.<br><br>

  Even the fact that you once lived in a peaceful tree house<br>
  and now live over a quarry of noise and dust<br>
  cannot make you unhappy.<br><br>

  Everything has a life of its own,<br>
  it too could wake up filled with possibilities<br>
  of coffee cake and ripe peaches,<br>
  and love even the floor which needs to be swept,<br>
  the soiled linens and scratched records&hellip;..<br><br>
  
  Since there is no place large enough<br>
  to contain so much happiness,<br>
  you shrug, you raise your hands, and it flows out of you<br>
  into everything you touch. You are not responsible.<br>
  You take no credit, as the night sky takes no credit<br>
  for the moon, but continues to hold it, and share it,<br>
  and in that way, be known.</p>
