<h1>Could Have</h1>
<h2>Wislawa Szymborska</h2>
<h4>View With a Grain of Sand, trans. Stanislaw Baranczak and Clare Cavanagh (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1996</h4>

<p>
  It could have happened.<br>
  It had to happen.<br>
  It happened earlier. Later.<br>
  Nearer. Farther off.<br><br>

  It happened, but not to you. <br>
  You were saved because you were the first.<br>
  You were saved because you were the last.<br>
  Alone. With others.<br>
  On the right. The left.<br>
  Because it was raining. Because of the shade.<br>
  Because the day was sunny.<br><br>

  You were in luck -- there was a forest.<br>
  You were in luck -- there were no trees.<br>
  You were in luck -- a rake, a hook, a beam, a brake,<br>
  A jamb, a turn, a quarter-inch, an instant . . .<br><br>
  So you're here? Still dizzy from<br>
  another dodge, close shave, reprieve?<br>
  One hole in the net and you slipped through?<br><br>

  I couldn't be more shocked or<br>
  speechless.<br>
  Listen,<br>
  how your heart pounds inside me.</p>
