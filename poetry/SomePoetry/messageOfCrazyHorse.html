<h1>the message of crazy horse</h1>

<h2>Lucille Clifton</h2>

<p>i would sit in the center of the world,<br>
the Black Hills hooped around me and<br>
dream of my dancing horse. my wife<br><br>

was Black Shawl who gave me the daughter<br>
i called They Are Afraid Of Her.<br>
i was afraid of nothing<br><br>

except Black Buffalo Woman.<br>
my love for her i wore<br>
instead of feathers. i did not dance<br><br>

i dreamed. i am dreaming now<br>
across the worlds. my medicine is strong.<br>
my medicine is strong in the Black basket<br>
of these fingers. i come again through this<br><br>

Black Buffalo woman. hear me;<br>
the hoop of the world is breaking.<br>
fire burns in the four directions.<br>
the dreamers are running away from the hills.<br>
    i have seen it. i am crazy horse.
