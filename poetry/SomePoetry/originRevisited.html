  <h1>The Origin Revisited</h1></a>
<h2>Ada Limon</h2>

<p2>
  — After a visit to the Yaak Valley in Kootenai National Forest, Montana, where the U.S. Forest Service has announced
  a logging project called Black Ram
  </p2>

  <p>
  What is there to be done now, but enter  <br>
              against abandonment, become a hollow sound  <br>
  <br>
in the halo of labyrinthine green, become a crossed-  <br>
             out word on the back of someone’s hand.  <br>
  <br>
Once, all of this became  <br>
  <br>
             all of this. One not-yet-golden western larch  <br>
curves by a white pine, a white pine
  <br>
             curves by a western hemlock, no one here  <br>
is heroic. To enter here is to enter
  <br>
magnitude, to feel an ecstatic somethingness,  <br>
             a nothingness of your own name.  <br>
  <br>
All words become wrong. A whole world exists  <br>
             without us. But who is us?  <br>
  <br>
Lichen, moss, grizzly scat, moose hoofprint like two  <br>
             exclamation points by the drying frog pond.  <br>
  <br>
How do you know you’re alive? What evidence  <br>
             will you leave? So many myths  <br>
  <br>
are unraveling; a yellow swallowtail glides by over  <br>
             the sinless creek bed. A storm  <br>
  <br>
wets the skin and we are surprised we have  <br>
             skin. Woods’ rose, white-flowered rhododendron,  <br>
  <br>
nothing here is unfinished. What it gave me? I saw  <br>
             a new tree emerge out of a ground made of ancient trees  <br>
  <br>
on top of more ancient trees, on top of more ancient trees,  <br>
             on top of more ancient trees, and understood then  <br>
  <br>
that this was how the Earth was made.  <br>
