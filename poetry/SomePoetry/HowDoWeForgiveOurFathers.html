<h1>How do we forgive our fathers?</h1>
<h2>last scene from Smoke Signals <br>from a poem by Dick Lourie</h2>

<p>
  How do we forgive our Fathers?<br>
  Maybe in a dream<br>
  Do we forgive our Fathers for leaving us too often or forever<br>
  when we were little?<br>

  Maybe for scaring us with unexpected rage<br>
  or making us nervous<br>
  because there never seemed to be any rage there at all.<br>

  Do we forgive our Fathers for marrying or not marrying our Mothers?<br>
  For divorcing or not divorcing our Mothers?<br>

  And shall we forgive them for their excesses of warmth or coldness?<br>
  Shall we forgive them for pushing or leaning<br>
  for shutting doors<br>
  for speaking through walls<br>
  or never speaking<br>
  or never being silent?<br>

  Do we forgive our Fathers in our age or in theirs<br>
  or their deaths<br>
  saying it to them or not saying it?<br>

  If we forgive our Fathers, what is left?<br>
