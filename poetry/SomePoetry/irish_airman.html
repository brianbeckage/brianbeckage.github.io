<h1>An Irish Airman Foresees His Death</h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<h2>William Butler Yeats</h2>

<p>Know that I shall meet my fate<br>
    Somewhere among the clouds above;<br>
    Those that I fight I do not hate,<br>
    Those that I guard I do not love;<br><br>

    My country is Kiltartan Cross,<br>
    My countrymen Kiltartan's poor,<br>
    No likely end could bring them loss<br>
    Or leave them happier than before.<br><br>

    Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,<br>
    Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,<br>
    A lonely impulse of delight<br>
    Drove to this tummult in the clouds;<br><br>

    I balanced all, brought all to mind,<br>
    The years to come seemed waste of breath,<br>
    A waste of breath the years behind<br>
    In balance with this life, this death.</p>
