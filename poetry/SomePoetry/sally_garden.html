<h1>Down by the Salley Gardens</h1>

<h2>William Butler Yeats</h2>

<p> Down by the salley gardens my love and I did meet;<br>
  She passed the salley gardens with little snow-white feet.<br>
  She bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree;<br>
  But I, being young and foolish, with her would not agree.<br><br>

  In a field by the river my love and I did stand,<br>
  And on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow-white hand.<br>
  She bid me take life easy, as the grass grows on the weirs;<br>
  But I was young and foolish, and now am full of tears.</p>
