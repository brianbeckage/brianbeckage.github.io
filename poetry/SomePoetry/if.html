<h1>If</h1>
<h2>Rudyard Kipling</h2>

<p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you<br>
    But make allowance for their doubting too,<br><br>

    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
    Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>
    Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>
    And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:<br><br>

    If you can dream--and not make dreams your master,<br>
    If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
    And treat those two impostors just the same;<br><br>

    If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
    Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
    And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:<br><br>

    If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
    And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
    And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
    And never breath a word about your loss;<br><br>

    If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
    And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
    Except the Will which says to them: &quot;Hold on!&quot;<br><br>

    If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
    Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch,<br>
    If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;<br>
    If all men count with you, but none too much,<br><br>

    If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
    With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br>
    Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
    And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!</p>
