<h1>Waiting for the Barbarians</h1>
<h2>C.P. Cavafy</h2>
<h4>The Collected Poems by C.P. Cavafy, translated by Evangelos Sachperoglou </h4>
<p>
  &ndash; What are we waiting for, assembled in the forum?<br>
  The barbarians are to arrive today.<br><br>

  &ndash; Why then such inactivity in the Senate?<br>
  Why do the Senators sit back and do not legislate?<br><br>
  Because the barbarians will arrive today.<br>
  What sort of laws now can Senators enact?<br>
  When the barbarians come, they&rsquo;ll do the legislating.<br><br>

  &ndash; Why is our emperor up so early,<br>
  and seated at the grandest gate of our city, upon the throne,<br>
  in state, wearing the crown?<br><br>
  Because the barbarians will arrive today.<br>
  And the emperor expects to receive their leader.<br>
  He has even prepared to present him<br>
  with a parchment scroll where he has<br>
  invested him with many names and titles.<br><br>

  &ndash; Why have our two consuls and the praetors come out<br>
  today in their purple, embroidered togas;<br>
  why did they put on bracelets studded with amethysts,<br>
  and rings with resplendent, glittering emeralds;<br>
  why are they carrying today precious staves<br>
  beautifully worked in gold and silver?<br><br>
  Because the barbarians will arrive today<br>
  and such things dazzle the barbarians.<br><br>

  &ndash; And why don&rsquo;t our distinguished orators come out as usual<br>
  to give their speeches, say what they have to say?<br><br>
  Because the barbarians will arrive today;<br>
  and they are bored by rhetoric and public speeches.<br><br>

  &ndash; Why this sudden commotion, this confusion?<br>
  (How solemn people&rsquo;s faces have become.)<br>
  Why are the streets and the squares emptying so quickly,<br>
  and everyone is returning home lost in thought?<br><br>
  Because night has fallen and the barbarians have not come.<br>
  And some of our men have arrived from the frontiers,<br>
  and say that there are no barbarians anymore.<br><br>
  &mdash;And now, what will become of us without barbarians?<br>
  Those people were a kind of solution.</p>
