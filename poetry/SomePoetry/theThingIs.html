<h1>The Thing is</h1>
<h2>Ellen Bass</h2>

<p>to love life, to love it even<br>
when you have no stomach for it<br>
and everything youâ€™ve held dear<br>
crumbles like burnt paper in your hands,<br>
your throat filled with the silt of it.<br>
When grief sits with you, its tropical heat<br>
thickening the air, heavy as water<br>
more fit for gills than lungs;<br>
when grief weights you down like your own flesh<br>
only more of it, an obesity of grief,<br>
you think, How can a body withstand this?<br>
Then you hold life like a face<br>
between your palms, a plain face,<br>
no charming smile, no violet eyes,<br>
and you say, yes, I will take you<br>
I will love you, again.<br>
</p>
