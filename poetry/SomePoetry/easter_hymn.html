<h1>Easter Hymn</h1>
<h2>A. E. Housman</h2>

<p>If in that Syrian garden, ages slain,<br>
    You sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,<br>
    Nor even in dreams behold how dark and bright<br>
    Ascends in smoke and fire by day and night<br>
    The hate you died to quench and could but fan,<br>
    Sleep well and see no morning, son of man.<br>
    <br>
    But if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,<br>
    At the right hand of majesty on high<br>
    You sit, and sitting so remember yet<br>
    Your tears, your agony and bloody sweat,<br>
    Your cross and passion and the life you gave,<br>
    Bow hither out of heaven and see and save.</><br>
