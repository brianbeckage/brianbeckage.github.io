We will come        back together as a single large group to share answers to the questions and other thoughts on the readings.        This will also present an opportunity to ask general questions about the readings.  This will also provide a        review prior to taking a short quiz on the readings that will be posted in Blackboard at the end of class        each week.</p></li>        <p><li><b>Supporting videos.</b> In the second 45 minute portion of each class, we will together watch 30 to 40 minutes        of a supporting video, followed by time for questions and reaction to the information presented in the video.        Each student will address an assigned question in an online discussion thread outside of class.</p> </li>        <p><li><b>R.</b> In the third 45 minute section of class, students will work on an assigned        exercise to learn system dynamics approaches to modeling using the graphical programing language Stella. </p>        </li>         <p><li><b>Exercises.</b> In the third 45 minute section of class, students will work on an assigned        exercise to learn system dynamics approaches to modeling using the graphical programing language Stella. </p>        </li>    </ol><br>    <h1>      <section id="CourseGoals"> Course Goals </section>      <a href="#CourseTitle">        <h3>Back to top</h3>      </a>    </h1>    <ol>Students will      <li>gain proficiency in the R statistical programming language</li>      <li>learn to construct and use likelihood functions.</li>      <li>learn to use information theoretic approaches to statistical inference.</li>        <li>become familiar with Bayesian approaches to statistical inference.</li>    </ol>    <br>    <br>    <p>Achieving these goals will require:</p>    <ul>        <li>Completion of assigned readings and exercises</li>        <li>Attendance and participation in classroom discussions</li>    </ul>    <br>    <h1>      <section id="Grading">Grading</section>      <a href="#CourseTitle">        <h3>Back to top</h3>      </a></h1>    <p>Student grades will be based on the following four components: </p>    <ol>      <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xLeE2lJhv1MX_wwt9p7VwUbATm8-eDf4-U6HRmavu-I/edit?usp=sharing">          Presentations of assigned book chapters</a>  (<strong>20%</strong> of final grade).          Here is an example of a <a href= "ProjectExample/exampleModel.png">Stella model</a>,          <a href="ProjectExample/exampleResearchPaper.pdf" >final paper</a>, and          <a href="ProjectExample/Cap&Trade.pdf">presentation</a>          from previous classes. </li>      <li>A corresponding <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xLeE2lJhv1MX_wwt9p7VwUbATm8-eDf4-U6HRmavu-I/edit?usp=sharing">class presentation</a>        on your research project&nbsp; during the final week of class.
