The course includes a    focus on the R language as a tool for data modeling and emphasizes examples and case studies from ecological    and environmental sciences.</p><br><p><i><b>Class Structure.</b></i> This class will meet three times a week for 3.75 hours (yes, 3 hours and 45 minutes!).    But we will take frequent breaks and will engage in a variety of activities, including discussions, watching videos,    and small group work, to break up the meetings. Each meeting will be divided into four    ~45 minute components with a ~10 minute break between components.</p><ol>    <p><li><b>Readings.</b> We will discuss the assigned readings for that class periods in small groups and in the    class as a whole. This will also present an opportunity to ask  questions or seek clarification about the readings.    These discussions will  provide a review prior to taking a short quiz on the readings that will be posted in    Blackboard.</p></li>    <p><li><b>Supporting videos.</b> In each class period, we will a pre-recorded lecture, by the author    (Richard McElreath) of our main text, where he presents each chapter. (I choose this book in part because of these    video lectures). This will reinforce our chapter readings and provide further explanation of assigned material. As you    are watching these video lectures, please ask questions, make comments, and respond to your classmates' questions using    Yellowdig. Following the lecture, we will discuss the chapters first in small breakout rooms and then    in the main group. We will repeat this for a series of R videos.  These videos do not correspond to our readings in    R but provide another perspective on programming in R.</p> </li>    <p><li><b>Exercises.</b> Each class period, students will receive a set of problems that incorporate the    statistical and/or R programming components of the class. Students will work in small groups during class on    these problems and will complete them outside of class if not completed in class.  Although sharing of information    and ideas is encouraged as a means of learning the material, each student should produce their own solutions (i.e.,    should write their own R code). </p>    </li>    <p><li><b>Chapter presentations.</b> Beginning in the second week of class, the assigned readings on statistics (not R)    from McElreath and Hobbs and Hooten will be presented by pairs of students.  These presentations should summarize    and outline the material presented in the readings, including the most important and key points, and should highlight    components that were confusing or unclear. These presentations should be roughly 20 to 25 mins. </p>    </li></ol><br><h1>    <section id="CourseGoals"> Course Goals </section>    <a href="#CourseTitle">        <h3>Back to top</h3>    </a></h1><ol><h2>Students will</h2>    <li>gain proficiency in the R statistical programming language</li>    <li>learn to construct and use likelihood functions.</li>    <li>learn to use information theoretic approaches to statistical inference.</li>    <li>become familiar with Bayesian approaches to statistical inference.</li></ol><br><br><p>Achieving these goals will require:</p><ul>    <li>Completion of assigned readings and exercises</li>    <li>Attendance and participation in classroom discussions</li></ul><br><h1>    <section id="Grading">Grading</section>    <a href="#CourseTitle">        <h3>Back to top</h3>    </a></h1><p>Student grades will be based on the following components: </p><table class="table4">    <tr>        <th> <h2>Grading for Undergraduate students </h2></th>        <th> <h2>Grading for Graduate students </h2></th>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>                <ol>                    <li>Class presentation of assigned chapters: 20% of course grade.</li>                    <li>Participation in discussions through Yellowdig: 20% of course grade.</li>                    <li>Quizzes on assigned readings: 10% of course grade.</li><!--                    <li>Class participation: 10% of course grade.</li>-->                    <li>Homework assignments: 35% of course grade. </li>                    <li>Final exam (take home): 15% of course grade. </li>                    </li>                </ol>        </td>        <td >                <ol>                    <li>Class presentation of assigned chapters: 20% of course grade.</li>                    <li>Participation in discussions through Yellowdig: 20% of course grade.</li>                    <li>Quizzes on assigned readings: 10% of course grade.</li><!--                    <li>Class participation: 10% of course grade.</li>-->                    <li>Homework assignments: 30% of course grade. </li>                    <li><a href="GraduateDataAnalysis.html">Data analysis project:</a> 10% of course grade.</li>                    <li>Final exam (take home): 10% of course grade. </li></ol>        </td>    </tr></table><br><h1>    <section id="Books">Books and Media</section>    <a href="#CourseTitle">        <h3>Back to top</h3>    </a></h1><p>Students will also be assigned readings from the following set of books (below).
