### Reproduce Fig. 5.1 using your own code.
### Create a prior, a likelihood function, and calculate the posterior distribution.
### for data z=1, n=1; z=10, n=40

### Vary the sample size of the data while keeping the proportion of successes constant

### Vary the prior while keeping sample size constant at z=10, n=40

### Explain your results.
