# Introduction to likelihood
Lets distinguish between a sampling distribution and a likelihood. First, plot the sampling distribution of a binomial process
with a p=0.5 and 4 trials.

```{r}
rbinom(n=20,size=4,prob=0.5)
```
We can approximate the sampling distribution from the samples:

```{r}
x<-rbinom(n=10000,size=4,prob=0.5)
xProb<-hist(x,plot=FALSE)
xProb$counts<-xProb$counts/sum(xProb$counts)
hist(xProb)
```

```{r}
plot(0:4,dbinom(x=0:4,size=4,prob=0.5),ylab="Prob",xlab="Number of Successes",ylim=c(0,0.4))
mtext(side=3,"Sampling Distribution",line=1)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
