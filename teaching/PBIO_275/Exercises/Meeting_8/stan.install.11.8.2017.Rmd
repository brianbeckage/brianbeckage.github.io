Exercise 1:  Intstall Stan.  See the installation links on the class website for the week of 11.8.2017.



Excercise 2:  Test your installation by running the Example 1: Eight Schools Stan code found in the 'RStan Getting Started' link on the class website for the week of 11.8.2017.



Exercise 3: Use Stan to fit a linear regression to simulated data to recapture the b0, b1, and sd parameters. This link might be useful: https://www.r-bloggers.com/bayesian-regression-with-stan-part-1-normal-regression/. You can simulate data using the following code:


```{r}
nReps<-10
x<-seq(from=0,to=100,by=1)
x<-rep(x,nReps)
b0<-1.0; b1<-0.2
ymean<-b0+b1*x
y<-rnorm(n=length(ymean),mean=ymean,sd=1.5)
N<-length(y)
myData<-data.frame(x,y)
```
