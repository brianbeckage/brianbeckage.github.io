We will consider a wide range of concepts including the physics of climate change,  impacts on ecological    communities, and human drivers of climate change. We place global climate change in the broader context of the    Earth system, and will adopt a systems approach to understanding climate change.</p><br><h1>    <section id="CourseGoals"> Course Goals </section>    <a href="#CourseTitle">        <h3>Back to top</h3>    </a></h1><ol><h2>Course objectives</h2>    <li>1. The student will be able to describe and compare the natural and human drivers of climate change.</li>    <li>2. The student will be able to list the primary ecological impacts of climate change and analyze how these        ecological impacts can feed back to the climate system. </li>    <li>3.The student will be able to apply a systems approach to analyzing the relationships between the human,        natural, climate components of the Earth system.</li></ol><br><p><i><b>Class Structure.</b></i> We will achieve our class objectives through a combination of consist of readings, videos, and online discussions. Reading will be    from the course textbooks as well as from other scientific papers and online sources. Students will be assessed    using weekly quizzes, a midterm exam, and a cumulative final exam. </p><ol>    <p><li><b>Readings.</b> We will discuss the assigned readings for that class periods in small groups and in the    class as a whole. This will also present an opportunity to ask  questions or seek clarification about the readings.    These discussions will  provide a review prior to taking a short quiz on the readings that will be posted in    Blackboard.</p></li>    <p><li><b>Supporting videos.</b> In each class period, we will a pre-recorded lecture, by the author    (Richard McElreath) of our main text, where he presents each chapter. (I choose this book in part because of these    video lectures). This will reinforce our chapter readings and provide further explanation of assigned material. As you    are watching these video lectures, please ask questions, make comments, and respond to your classmates' questions using    Yellowdig. Following the lecture, we will discuss the chapters first in small breakout rooms and then    in the main group. We will repeat this for a series of R videos.  These videos do not correspond to our readings in    R but provide another perspective on programming in R.</p> </li>    <p><li><b>Exercises.</b> Each class period, students will receive a set of problems that incorporate the    statistical and/or R programming components of the class. Students will work in small groups during class on    these problems and will complete them outside of class if not completed in class.  Although sharing of information    and ideas is encouraged as a means of learning the material, each student should produce their own solutions (i.e.,    should write their own R code). </p>    </li>    <p><li><b>Chapter presentations.</b> Beginning in the second week of class, the assigned readings on statistics (not R)    from McElreath and Hobbs and Hooten will be presented by pairs of students.  These presentations should summarize    and outline the material presented in the readings, including the most important and key points, and should highlight    components that were confusing or unclear. These presentations should be roughly 20 to 25 mins. </p>    </li></ol><br><h1>    <section id="Grading">Grading</section>    <a href="#CourseTitle">        <h3>Back to top</h3>    </a></h1><p>Student grades will be based on the following components: </p><table class="table4">    <tr>        <th> <h2>Grading for Undergraduate students </h2></th>        <th> <h2>Grading for Graduate students </h2></th>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>            <ol>                <li>Participation in discussions through Yellowdig: 30% of course grade.</li>                <li>Quizzes on assigned materials: 30% of course grade.</li>                <li>Midterm exam: 15% of course grade. </li>                <li>Final exam: 25% of course grade. </li>            </ol>        </td>        <td >            <ol>                <li>Participation in discussions through Yellowdig: 30% of course grade.</li>                <li>Quizzes on assigned materials: 30% of course grade.</li>                <li>Midterm exam: 10% of course grade. </li>                <li>Final exam: 20% of course grade. </li>                <li><a href="GraduateDataAnalysis.html">Research paper:</a> 10% of course grade.</li>            </ol>        </td>    </tr></table><br><h1>    <section id="Books">Books and Media</section>    <a href="#CourseTitle">        <h3>Back to top</h3>    </a></h1><p>Students will also be assigned readings from the following set of books (below).
