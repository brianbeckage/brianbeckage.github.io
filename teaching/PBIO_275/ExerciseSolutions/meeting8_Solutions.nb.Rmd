8H1.  Return to the data(tulips) example in the chapter. Now include the bed variable as a predictor in the interaction model. Donâ€™t interact bed with the other predictors; just include it as a main effect. Note that bed is categorical. So to use it properly, you will need to either construct dummy variables or rather an index variable, as explained in Chapter 5.

```{r}
library(rethinking)
data(tulips)
d<-tulips
d$blooms_std <- d$blooms / max(d$blooms) 
d$water_cent <- d$water - mean(d$water) 
d$shade_cent <- d$shade - mean(d$shade)
d$bedID<-as.numeric(d$bed)

modelTulipBed<- quap(
    alist(
        blooms_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
        mu <- betaB[bed] + betaS*shade_cent + betaW*water_cent + 
          betaI*shade_cent*water_cent,
        betaS~dnorm(0,0.5),
        betaW~dnorm(0,0.5),
        betaI~dnorm(0,0.5),
        betaB[bed]~dnorm(0,0.5),
        sigma ~ dunif( 0 , 50 )
    ) , data=d)

precis(modelTulipBed,depth=2)
```
