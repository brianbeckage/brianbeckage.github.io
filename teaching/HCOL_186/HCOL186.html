We will examine anthropogenic climate      change as part of an integrated earth system that includes impacts on and      feedbacks with human systems. We will consider the challenges and      interactions between climate change and human societies by considering      responses of current and past societies to climate change and      environmental degradation. We will place anthropogenic climate change in      the broader context of limits to growth, sustainability, and societal      development. The class will emphasize readings, discussions, and      construction of simple simulation models to understand the scientific and      social basis of contemporary climate and sustainability. Students will use      the graphical computer programming language Stella to develop a simplified      model of the Earth system.</p><br>    <p><i><b>Class Structure.</b></i> This class will meet once a week for 3 hours. Each meeting will be divided into        three 50 minute components with        a 10 minute break between components.</p>    <ol>        <p><li><b>Readings.</b> The first 50 minutes will be a discussion of the readings for that week.        Part of this time will be spent in small groups addressing assigned questions about the readings. We will come back together        as a single large group to share answers to the questions and other thoughts on the readings.  This will also        present an opportunity to ask general questions about the readings.  This will also provide a review prior to taking a short        quiz on the readings that will be posted in Blackboard at the end of class each week.</p></li>        <p><li><b>Videos.</b> In the second 50 minute        portion of each class, we will together watch 30 to 40 minutes of a documentary, followed by time for        questions and reaction to the information presented in the video. Each student will address an assigned question in an online        discussion thread outside of class.</p> </li>        <p><li><b>Modeling.</b> In the third 50 minute section of class, students will work on an assigned        exercise to learn system        dynamics approaches to modeling using the graphical programing language Stella. </p></li>    </ol><br>    <h1>      <section id="CourseGoals"> Course Goals </section>      <a href="#CourseTitle">        <h3>Back to top</h3>      </a>    </h1>    <!--<p>1.
