 <p class="quotes"> Like resilience, self-organization is often sacrificed for purposes of short-term productivity and stability.
     Productivity and stability are the usual excuses for turning creative human beings into mechanical
     adjuncts to production processes. Or for narrowing the genetic variability of crop plants.
     Or for establishing bureaucracies and theories of knowledge that treat people as if they were only numbers.
     <br>
	Self-organization produces heterogeneity and unpredictability. It is likely come up with whole new structures,
     whole new ways of doing things. It requires freedom and experimentation, and a certain amount of disorder.
     These conditions that encourage self-organization often can be scary for individuals and threatening to
     power structures. As a consequence, education systems may restrict the creative powers of children
     instead of stimulating those powers. Economic policies may lean toward supporting established, powerful
     enterprises rather than upstart, new ones. And many governments prefer their people not to be too
     self-organizing.
